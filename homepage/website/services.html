                    <h2>Covid Tracker <a class="service-public-status">Public</a></h2>
                    <p>This was a coding project that my dad and I worked on during covid. He wanted to do some data analysis to fact check what was reported on about the covid rates. I wanted some practice with hosting web applications on PWS v1, and hosted the <a href="https://covid.whitney.rip">covid tracker website</a> for him on PWS.</p>
                    <p>The website renders various charts, tables, and dashboards by interest. It additionally has a few "Checker" utilities to compare cases across cities and availability within hospitals.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, as of 2024, the US government website we scraped data for has stopped sharing information, and unfortunately this marks the end for this project. However, we still run it on PWS with the most recent batch of data.</p>
                    <p>Some stretch goals for this project include caching with <a href="https://nginx.org/en/">Nginx</a>, or converting it to a different framework like <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a>.</p>

                    <p>I host a personal <a href="https://gallery.whitney.rip">photo gallery</a> of memories that I'd like to remember. <a href="https://www.photoprism.app/">Photoprism</a> makes a great open source(!) solution for doing this that is better than most other comparable projects. Its features list is rather long, and can give you a pretty decent Google Photos impression.</p>

                    <h2>Websites <a class="service-public-status">Public</a></h2>
                    <p>There are a few one-of websites that I host off of PWS. One is my <a href="https://recipes.whitney.rip">Recipes Website</a>, a ad-less, bloat-less recipes website that actually tells you how to cook something instead of trying to sell you on a cookbook or something. This was written around the time that ChatGPT was becoming a household name, and this was a great project to start to learn some of the capabilities on.</p>
                    <p>Some other sites include my personal website (where I blog on some of these projects), and, of course, this PWS website!</p>

                    <p>I have a few YouTube channels whose original video files I like to keep an archive of. It's perfectly fine to just host the files and play them in a media player, but self-hosting <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a> allows me to slap on a UI for essentially free.</p>

                    <h2>Discord Bots <a class="service-public-status">Public</a></h2>
                    <p>At one point, when creating discord servers for special interest groups I was a part of, I found that moderation and automation were a problem with the default discord server owner experience.</p>
                    <p>I tried using a paid discord bot to solve some of these problems, and eventually liked it enough to purchase a lifetime subscription. However, that bot's owners started to lock features away under additional tiers and I became unhappy.</p>
                    <p>Just unhappy enought to sit down and learn how to use the Discord Api. With the help of the Discord API for Python, and ChatGPT by my side, I have started a <a href="https://github.com/runyanjake/discord">repository</a> containing some of the bots and features I have written for them. It's a nice, fun way to add functionality to a service that some of my friends choose to congregate on.</p>

                    <p>Every few winters, people get stuck inside due to rain or snow and want to play some games. In the past, PWS has hosted a minecraft server to scratch that itch. Third party plugins like Dynmap allowed us to elevate the experience by hosting a live-updating <a href="https://minemap.whitney.rip">server map</a>, which is where the screenshot comes from.</p>
