# Plex

A self hosted plex server for home videos.

## Instructions

### File System
Create the following mounted folders or connect a drive with your data.
- `/pwspool/plex/tvseries`
- `/pwspool/plex/movies`
- `/pwspool/plex/photos`
- `/pwspool/plex/homevideos`
- `/pwspool/plex/transcode`

## Notes
When navigating to plex, assuming no nginx routing is happening, you must go to `https://[url]/web/index.html#!/` for first time setup.
