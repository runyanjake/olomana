                        <p>This was a collaborative project between my dad and I during the Covid-19 pandemic. He had wanted to do some data analysis to fact check what was being reported on in the news. I wanted some practice with hosting web applications, and so I hosted the <a href="https://covid.whitney.rip">covid tracker website</a> for him on PWS.</p>
                        <p>The website renders various charts, tables, and dashboards by interest. It additionally has a few "Checker" utilities to compare cases across cities and availability within hospitals.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, as of 2024, the US government website we scraped data for has stopped sharing information, and unfortunately this marks the end for this project. However, we still run it on PWS with the most recent batch of data.</p>
                        <p>Some stretch goals for this project include caching with <a href="https://nginx.org/en/">Nginx</a>, or converting it to a different framework like <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a>.</p>

                        <p>At one point, when creating discord servers for special interest groups I was a part of, I found that moderation and automation were a problem with the default discord server owner experience.</p>
                        <p>I tried using a paid discord bot to solve some of these problems, and eventually liked it enough to purchase a lifetime subscription. However, that bot's owners started to lock features away under additional tiers and I became unhappy.</p>
                        <p>Just unhappy enought to sit down and learn how to use the Discord Api. With the help of the Discord API for Python, and ChatGPT by my side, I have started a <a href="https://github.com/runyanjake/discord">repository</a> containing some of the bots and features I have written for them. It's a nice, fun way to add functionality to a service that some of my friends choose to congregate on.</p>

                        <p>A majority of my public facing code lives on Github, but some projects are publically hosted or mirrored to/from Github from my Gitea instance. This open source software has near feature parity with Github, and is a great option for self hosting private or semi-private code.</p>

                        <p>After hosting my photos using other photo hosting software, I eventually discovered Immich, a modern Google Photos-like open-source software.</p>
                        <p>So far it has been a resilient and mostly user-friendly software that I use to store, share, and revisit my photos.</p>

                        <p>This was written around the time that ChatGPT was becoming a household name, and it was a good project to begin learning how to responsibly vibe code.</p>

                        <p>I have hosted many versions of my <a href="https://jake.runyan.dev">personal website</a> on PWS.</p>
                        <p>The first version was written in high school using pure javascript/css/html.</p>
                        <p>Later, I wrote a simple content focused React framework that rendered a custom markdown format into webpages, and hosted a very plain looking version of my website.</p>
                        <p>Most recently, I have chosed to self host the <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> open-source framework, a much more feature-rich blogging framework that was written with many of the same intentions as my framework. In the future I plan to revamp my framework, but for now Ghost will be my driver for a modern, sleek, personal website.</p>

                        <p>After some incidents, the server has been privatized for a whitelisted group of friends.</p>
